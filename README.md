# Summer Project
This project aims to create an application to control a robot so that it can move an item (matches) from its original location to the desired location using hand gestures. As an input device, the robot used the [Logitech C922 PRO HD STREAM WEBCAM](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) and for hand gestures used a laptop webcam. The robot used is [UFACTORY uArm](https://www.ufactory.cc/product-page/ufactory-uarm-test-kit) with Suction Cup.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage
```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
